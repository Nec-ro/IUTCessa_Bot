# IUTCessa Bot — Telegram Bot for IUT Computer Engineering Student Scientific Association 🛠🤖

**IUTCessa Bot** is a Telegram bot specifically designed for the Computer Engineering Department at Isfahan University of Technology (IUT), under the supervision of the IUT Computer Engineering Student Scientific Association (IUTCessa).

---

## 🚀 Goal

Its primary goal is to establish a management and automation system for various association initiatives, such as:

- **Kmkyar** — a program to help with volunteer assistance program 🤝
- **Tech-Stack Mentoring Courses** — Tech Stack mentoring courses 📚

---

## 🧩 Main Parts

- **Tech Stack (`techstack`)** — handles key tasks including launching registration panels, sending general or targeted notifications, managing priority selection panels, database administration, and overseeing payment receipts. (Both user and admin panels)
- **Volunteer Program (`kmkyar`)** — apply to help, and get links for the selected group.

---

## 🤖 AI Helper (v1.3.0+)

A new AI part (run by the Gemma model) was added and is still being worked on. It can now:

- **TL;DR / sum up** — make long texts short and easy to get.
- **Ask / chat mode** — ask the bot things and talk to it in simple words.

> Note: the AI helper is still being tested and changed — look for more and better parts.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Configuration is provided via environment variables loaded from a local `.env` file (not committed).
Use `.env.sample` as a template.

Key modules you may edit:

- `src/core/tokens.py` *(deprecated — use `.env` instead)*  
- `src/core/command_functions.py`
- Other helpers in `src/core/`
